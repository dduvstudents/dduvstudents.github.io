The R language is a computing environment and a very flexible and rich
progamming language used for statistical data analysis. It's a free 
and open source software that is regularly enriched with new libraries
of functions provided by users. In particular, everyone can create a 
package.

This training is offered by the **SMCS**. 

## Objectives

At the end of this training, the participant will be familiar with
different data visualisation tools in R. He will also learn how to
efficiently reproduce the same analysis and how to include R outputs 
in a document (pdf, word...).

## Prerequisites

A basic knowledge of R is required (cf. the first day of the training 
hereafter): *Introduction to data analysis with R*

## Content

- Efficient data visualisation : R base graphics and ggplot2
- Efficient programmation : loops and functions 
- Reporting

## Location

Online through TEAMS
